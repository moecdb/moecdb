# Mohamed Sidibé

Founder & systems architect building AI-powered SaaS products for African markets.

## What I care about
- Real revenue, not vanity metrics
- Commission > subscription in emerging markets
- WhatsApp-first products
- Strong data isolation 
- Simple UX, heavy backend discipline

> Most of my work lives in private repositories.
> Public repos document architecture, strategy, and patterns — not core IP.
