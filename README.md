# Mohamed Sidibé

Founder & systems architect building AI-powered SaaS products for African markets.

## What I’m building
- **Ahiwa** — a 24/7 AI WhatsApp vendor for African sellers  
- **GLOBALYS AFRIQUE** — multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure (HR, Commerce, Ops)
- Commission-based models inspired by Visa / Mastercard economics

## What I care about
- Real revenue, not vanity metrics
- Commission > subscription in emerging markets
- WhatsApp-first products
- Strong data isolation (RLS, multi-tenant design)
- Simple UX, heavy backend discipline

## Tech stack
- Next.js (App Router) / Turborepo
- Supabase (Auth, RLS, Edge Functions)
- WhatsApp Business API (360dialog)
- Mobile Money (Wave, Orange, MTN)
- AI routing (LLM-agnostic)

> Most of my work lives in private repositories.
> Public repos document architecture, strategy, and patterns — not core IP.
